      <description>Sometimes I think about what a bliss computers are. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean in a way of how they have improved our quality of life (which they did) and I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to disregard of the fact that they have had and will continue to have lots of implications on our social interactions and sociatal perception. What I mean is the fact that we now have these machines which obey exactly the way as we tell them to.</description>
